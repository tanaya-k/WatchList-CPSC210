# My Personal Project: Watchlist for TV shows and movies

### Creates a watchlist that:
- records the **title** of the media
- lists whether the user is **currently watched or has watched** the media before
- displays the **genre** of the media
- edits a **rating of the media** from 1 to 5, and a **short review**
- shows the number of media watched
- shows the number of media being watched currently

#### *Who will use my application?*
Regular movie-goers/tv show enthusiasts or people who want to record the media they watch

#### *Why did I create a watchlist?*
I've always wanted to know the list of shows and movies I am currently watching with extra information if needed in a 
format that is fully customizable and with the display matching each person's preference.

#### *User Stories:*
- As a user, I want to be able to add a media into either a currently watching list or finished watching list
- As a user, I want to be able to tag the media as a film or show

- As a user, I want to be able to save my watch lists and have the option to do so from the start-up menu
- As a user, I want to be able to load my watch lists from file and choose to do so from the start-up menu
